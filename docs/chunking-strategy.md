# Chunking & Retrieval Strategy (design)

_Status: DESIGN — not yet implemented. Drafted 2026-06-03._
_Owner: operator. Supersedes the "add a vector store at ~200 docs" placeholder in `research/docs/tech-team-memo-draft.md`._

## 0. Current state (what this replaces)

Today there is **no chunking pipeline**. Company notes (`notes/{TICKER}/*.md`) are git-tracked markdown, searched with `grep` and read **whole** by agents, selected by *freshness rank* (`MAX(event_date, ingestion_date)`). There is a doc-level metadata layer already — `DocMetadata` (`scripts/metadata/schema.py`) + `config/document-index.jsonl` — but nothing below the document.

This document specifies the layer below the document: how a note becomes retrievable *pieces*, and what each piece is tagged with.

## 1. Core principle: chunking ≠ faceting (three independent axes)

The analytical lenses the operator cares about (supply chain, margins, FCF, management…) are **not** a chunking strategy — they are a *faceting taxonomy*, the dimensions we retrieve **by**. One sentence in an earnings call routinely spans four of them:

> "Data-center revenue grew 154% as hyperscaler capex accelerated and we took share from merchant silicon, though gross margin compressed 200bps on the Blackwell ramp."
> → revenue + market + competitive-advantage + margins, in one breath.

Chunking *by* facet would force that sentence to be duplicated or arbitrarily filed. Instead:

- **Axis 1 — Chunk unit (physical):** split by the *grammar of the source* (Q&A pair, speaker turn, section).
- **Axis 2 — Facet (semantic label):** multi-label each chunk with the analytical taxonomy (§4).
- **Axis 3 — Theme (cross-company narrative):** the existing `watchlist.yaml` themes (`hyperscaler_capex_buildout`, `agent_framework_landscape`, …).

A query then composes all three: _"margin commentary [facet] tagged `hyperscaler_capex_buildout` [theme] from Q1'26 earnings [provenance] across the hyperscalers."_

## 2. Two stores, not one (the spine)

The facets the operator cares about most — revenue, margins, FCF, comps, **guidance-beat track record** — are **numbers**, and vector search is bad at numbers ("NVDA DC gross margin Q3'26 vs Q3'25" is a table lookup; an embedding returns the wrong quarter). So:

| | **Store A — narrative** | **Store B — structured metrics** |
|---|---|---|
| What | prose chunks: transcripts, podcasts, conf, operator notes | numbers, keyed `ticker × period × metric` |
| Holds | the *why* — framing, demand color, moat commentary | the *what* — actuals, consensus, guidance, beat/miss |
| Source | notes (this pipeline) | **FactSet** (`Fundamentals`, `EstimatesConsensus`, `Metrics`) + numbers extracted from notes |
| Retrieval | vector similarity + metadata filters | SQL / time-series lookup |

Both live in **one Postgres (pgvector)** so a `guidance` chunk in A can JOIN to B in a single query and the model sees *what they guided* (prose) **and** *their history of hitting it* (quant). This is the "RAG for narrative, SQL for numbers" pattern — the correct spine for an investing book. (Factor exposures, deferred, are also Store B machinery, not chunk facets.)

### 2a. Guidance-beat track record → a management-quality signal

In Store B, model guidance as a per-ticker time series: **guided range → consensus → actual → beat / miss / in-line + magnitude**, per quarter, per metric. Derive a **guidance-credibility score**: hit-rate, average beat magnitude, sandbag-vs-overpromise tendency. That score is attributable to the *management team* — so it is the quantitative bridge into the management dossier (§5). "Do these people sandbag?" is simultaneously a FactSet computation and a jockey signal. Mostly FactSet-sourced; worth the wiring.

## 3. Chunk units, by source type (Axis 1)

The boundary follows the grammar of the source. One size does **not** fit transcripts and podcasts.

| Source (`doc_type`) | Chunk unit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `earnings_transcript` — prepared remarks | topic-coherent paragraph, ~150–400 tok | scripted/dense; already topically segmented |
| `earnings_transcript` — Q&A | **one Q&A pair = one chunk** (analyst Q + full mgmt A) | highest-value chunk type. **Who answers is the signal; who asks is noise** — capture `answered_by`/`answerer_role` (CEO/CFO/IR) + `answer_directness`; the analyst-asker is `asker_citation` only, never ranked |
| `conference_transcript` | question→answer exchange | single moderator → clean turns |
| `podcast_transcript` | speaker-attributed **topic segment** | discursive; needs diarization (the `enrich_sidecars` Gemini pass already extracts speakers) |
| `operator_note` | **section-level** (the `##` headers) | already synthesized, high-signal, short — don't over-split |

### 3a. Parent–child (embed small, return large)

Match retrieval on the tight **atomic child** (a self-contained claim + its evidence, ~100–400 tok) for precision, but hand the LLM the **parent** (full Q&A pair / whole section / whole note) for context. LlamaIndex calls this auto-merging / parent-document retrieval. For a rambling multi-part analyst answer, the Q&A pair is the parent and the atomic sub-claims inside are children.

## 4. Facet taxonomy (Axis 2) — controlled enum

Multi-label, **validated against this enum** (StructuredOutput-style), **capped at ~3–4 facets/chunk** so the filter stays meaningful. Top-level → sub-facets:

1. `supply_chain` — customers, vendors, partners/ecosystem, channel, concentration
2. `competitive_advantage` — competition, market_share, moat (network_effects / switching_costs / scale / ip / brand / data)
3. `product` — momentum, leadership, roadmap, rnd_innovation, attach_crosssell
4. `revenue` — growth, comps, mix_segment, pricing, recurring_vs_onetime, backlog_rpo, retention_nrr_churn
5. `market` — tam, dynamics, substitution, growth, drivers
6. `margins` — operating, gaap_vs_nongaap, ebitda, incremental, gross, unit_economics
7. `fcf` — conversion, capex, growth
8. `capital_allocation` — buybacks, dividends, m_and_a, debt_paydown  _(split from FCF: "how much cash" vs "what they do with it")_
9. `risks` — regulatory, customer_concentration, tech_disruption, execution, macro_cyclical, key_person
10. `guidance` — forward outlook as a first-class facet (works with `time_orientation=forward` and the Store-B beat-rate join)
11. `operating_kpis` — leading indicators: arr, rpo, bookings, dau_mau, take_rate, attach_rate, asp, backlog
12. `regulatory_geopolitical` — export controls, antitrust, China policy (recurs across NVDA / GOOGL / BABA / BIDU / NTES)
13. `demand_signals` — qualitative: "elongated sales cycles", "budget scrutiny", "demand outstripping supply"
14. `capital_structure` — leverage, liquidity, debt maturities
15. `management` — commentary *this quarter*; biography lives in the dossier (§5)
16. `factor_exposures` — **parked**; derived from holdings/returns (Store B), not extracted from notes

## 5. Management — its own entity (defer build, fix schema now)

The operator weights the jockey, not just the horse: track record, pedigree, and personal origin (immigrant, single parent, learning disability, hardship overcome in youth — a resilience/grit signal). This data is **near-static and biographical**, lives in podcasts/interviews/profiles (almost never in earnings chunks), so it does **not** belong in transient note chunks. Model it like the `.pvt` profiles: a per-person dossier `people/{slug}/_profile.md`, embedded once, cross-referenced from company notes.

Sub-facets: `track_record` (prior P&L outcomes, capital-allocation history), `pedigree` (education, prior roles), `founder_origin` (adversity/grit), `incentive_alignment` (ownership %, comp), `tenure_turnover`, `key_person_risk`. Source the origin signal from on-record interviews; tag `confidence: biographical`; keep every claim cited. **Bridge:** `track_record` ← the guidance-credibility score from Store B (§2a).

**Decision:** build the `people/` entity *later*; reserve the schema now so note-RAG isn't blocked.

## 6. Chunk metadata schema (all three axes)

Extends `DocMetadata` (every chunk carries its parent doc's identity). New chunk-level fields in **bold**.

```jsonc
{
  // --- identity / lineage ---
  "chunk_id": "NVDA-1Q27-qa-07",      // stable, deterministic
  "doc_id": "<sha256 of source doc>", // FK → DocMetadata / document-index.jsonl
  "parent_id": "NVDA-1Q27-qa-section",// FK → parent chunk (auto-merge target)
  "text": "...",

  // --- provenance / structural (mostly inherited from DocMetadata) ---
  "ticker": "NVDA",                   // PER-SEGMENT (see §7) — may differ from doc.primary_ticker
  "doc_type": "earnings_transcript",
  "event_date": "2026-05-21",
  "fiscal_quarter": "1Q27",
  "answered_by": "Colette Kress",    // exec who RESPONDED — first-class signal
  "answerer_role": "CFO",             // CEO | CFO | COO | IR
  "answer_directness": "direct",      // direct | partial | evasive — answer quality is the alpha
  "asker_citation": "Buchalter (Cowen)", // analyst who asked — provenance ONLY, never ranked/filtered/boosted
  "transcript_provider": "factset",

  // --- the two fields the operator specifically endorsed ---
  "claim_source": "management",       // management | analyst_question | operator_opinion | sell_side | media
  "time_orientation": "forward",      // backward | current | forward

  // --- Axis 2: facets (multi-label, enum-validated, ≤4) ---
  "facets": ["margins.gross", "guidance", "product.roadmap"],

  // --- Axis 3: themes (existing watchlist taxonomy) ---
  "themes": ["silicon_architecture_competition", "hyperscaler_capex_buildout"]
}
```

Two fields financial RAG lives or dies on:
- **`claim_source`** — never let management spin retrieve as ground truth; lets us weight/filter conviction. `operator_opinion` (the operator's own synthesis) is the highest-signal value.
- **`time_orientation`** — "what's the margin" (backward/current) must not return a guide (forward).
- **`answered_by` / `answer_directness`** — on Q&A chunks the asker carries no alpha; the *answerer* and *how directly they answer* do. A CFO directly quantifying a margin question vs. a CEO punting to the analyst day is exactly the signal to filter and weight on — and it feeds the management dossier's credibility thread (§2a, §5). The analyst-asker is `asker_citation`, retained for provenance but excluded from ranking, filtering, and boosting.

## 7. Retrieval-time behavior

- **Per-segment ticker / multi-ticker fan-out.** Podcasts and `sector/` notes name several companies. Assign `ticker` *per chunk segment* (allow a list) so one podcast fans out to each ticker's retrieval instead of being misfiled under `primary_ticker`.
- **Recency decay.** Carry the existing freshness-rank philosophy into ranking — a Q1'24 margin comment should not tie a Q1'26 one for "current trajectory."
- **Operator-opinion boost.** Retrieval-time boost for `claim_source = operator_opinion` so the operator's conviction dominates raw transcript.
- **Hybrid by default.** Vector similarity + facet/theme/provenance as a **ranking boost, not a hard filter** (a hard facet gate costs recall@5 — see §11b; pgvector still handles the relational filtering Chroma can't, e.g. ticker/date scoping where a hard gate *is* correct).

## 8. How tags get assigned

LLM-tag at ingestion — a natural extension of `enrich_sidecars.py` (which already runs Gemini for doc-level extraction). Per chunk, emit `facets` + `themes` + `claim_source` + `time_orientation` via a StructuredOutput call against the §4 enum. Operator notes are nearly free: the 10 section headers map to facets ~1:1. The prototype (`scripts/chunking/`) uses **heuristic** taggers as a stand-in so it runs without an LLM; the production swap-in point is marked in code.

## 9. Decisions (locked)

| Decision | Call |
|---|---|
| Granularity | atomic-claim **+ parent-child** |
| Facet assignment | LLM at ingestion; **enum-validated**, **≤4 facets/chunk**. When >4 match, rank by **discrimination (rarity/IDF), not raw cue-frequency** — see §11; the heuristic prototype gets this backwards. |
| Management dossiers | **defer build, reserve schema now** |
| Store | **pgvector** (hosts A + B + dossiers; enables the JOIN) |
| First prototype | **earnings Q&A chunker** — highest value, cleanest boundaries, exercises guidance + claim_source + time_orientation + beat-rate join on one source type |

## 10. Build order

1. ✅ This design doc.
2. ✅ Q&A / section chunker prototype + starter eval set (`scripts/chunking/`). Markdown-note chunker (`chunker.py`) and raw-FactSet-transcript chunker (`transcript_chunker.py`, deterministic answerer-role + asker-cite-only) both run.
3. ✅ Eval set → 17 question→expected-chunk gold pairs (`eval_set.yaml`) + recall@k harness (`embed_experiment.py`, Gemini `gemini-embedding-001`).
   - **3a. ✅ Fixed the heuristic facet tagger (tf·idf ranking + broadened `operating_kpis` cue) + buyback gold-spec; re-ran (§11b). vector-only recall@5 14→17/17; soft facet-boost 14/16/17. Closed on NVDA-1Q27 only — see 3b.**
   - **3b. ✅ Added a 2nd gold note (GOOGL 1Q26, 15 cases) authored pre-fix (§11c). Found+fixed a hardcoded-roster gap (now per-doc from `speakers:` frontmatter) + 1 gold over-reach; GOOGL recall@5 12→15/15, NVDA no regressions, combined vector @5 = 32/32. Soft-boost retriever holds on a second note.**
4. ✅ Store-A schema + embedding + ingestion + retrieval job (`schema.sql`, `embed.py`, `store.py`, `ingest.py`, `retrieve.py`; §12). Retriever = vector + facet soft boost (NOT a hard gate, §11b–c). **Decision (2026-06-03): pgvector is the locked target, but runs file-backed *today* (`FileStore`, numpy cosine) — the JOIN that justifies a DB is Store B (step 5), so a daemon buys nothing at ~2.3k vectors. `schema.sql` is the durable pgvector spec; the swap to managed pgvector is the step-5 trigger (`CHUNK_STORE_BACKEND=pg`, `PgStore`).** Gold eval through the real store reproduces §11c exactly (soft-boost 25/31/32). Still 2 notes / NVDA-flavored cues → the LLM tagger (§8) is the real generalizer.
5. ◻ Store B: FactSet guidance-beat time series + credibility score → **also the managed-pgvector cutover** (the A↔B JOIN goes live here).
6. ◻ `people/` dossiers (deferred).

## 11. Embedding recall experiment (2026-06-03) — result

Real embeddings (Gemini `gemini-embedding-001`) vs. the keyword baseline, on **n = 17 gold cases, single note (NVDA 1Q27)** — directional, not conclusive at this n. The **§11a diagnosis below is pre-fix**; **§11b records the post-step-3a re-run** (the numbers the build now stands on).

### 11a. Pre-fix diagnosis

| Retriever | recall@1 | @3 | @5 |
|---|---|---|---|
| keyword baseline (`eval.py`) | 8/17 | — | — |
| vector only | 9 | 12 | 14 |
| vector + facet pre-filter | **11** | 12 | 14 |

**What holds:** the facet pre-filter lifts precision@1 (8→11); vector clearly beats keyword.

**What does NOT hold (corrected — earlier read was confirmation bias):** the 3 residual @5 misses are **not** "Store-B-only cases that validate the two-store split," and **none is a genuine retrieval failure either**. **0 of 3 are Store-B-only; 0 of 3 are vector-recall misses.** All three are chunker tagging/sectioning + gold-spec issues; the answer demonstrably lives in a Store-A chunk in every case:

- **Vera CPU TAM ($200B)** — the answer chunk was retrieved at **rank 1**; the eval rejected it only because the chunk lacks the `market` facet the gold asserts. Product-level TAM is management commentary; FactSet structured metrics (Store B) cannot hold it. → **tagger defect, not retrieval, not Store B.**
- **Segment KPI (Hyperscale/ACIE)** — the answer is in ~10 narrative chunks; **none** carries `operating_kpis`, and the query inferred no facet at all. → **tagger + query-cue coverage gap.**
- **Buyback authorization ($80B)** — **unwinnable at any rank, not a ranking miss.** The gold case asserts `expect_section: "Forward guidance"` AND `expect_contains: "$80B"`, but the `$80B` figure lives only in sections 1/2/7 (headline / actuals table / investor-signal); **no Forward-guidance chunk contains it.** `check()` substring-matches section, so every candidate fails on section regardless of rank. → **gold-spec/sectioning mismatch**: the case conflates "how much was authorized" (headline/table) with "capital-return policy" (Forward guidance, which carries only the ~50%-of-FCF / ~$100B policy). Also a Store-B dual (a hard dollar figure FactSet carries independently). Fix is to the gold spec (or section-boundary assignment), **not** the retriever.

**Root cause of the two tagger misses — a real defect in `tag_chunk`:**
1. **Frequency-ranked ≤4 cap drops the discriminating facet.** `tag_chunk` ranks facets by raw cue-match *count*, then caps at 4. On the TAM chunk the three kept facets (`revenue`/`supply_chain`/`product`) have count 2; `market` and `guidance` tie at count 1, and the 4th slot is decided by **dict insertion order** (`guidance` precedes `market`) — so `market`, the one facet the query keys on, is dropped arbitrarily. The cap is fine; the ranking is backwards in two ways (common facets outrank rare ones; ties break on dict order). Fix: weight by **discrimination (rarity/IDF), not raw count** — which both demotes boilerplate and removes the arbitrary tie-break.
2. **SaaS-shaped cue vocabulary.** `operating_kpis` only matches ARR/RPO/bookings/backlog — it misses hardware "new segment / submarket disclosure" KPIs entirely, on both the doc and query side.

**Gate decision:** the binding constraint is **chunker facet-tag ranking/coverage + sectioning/gold-spec, not retriever recall and not the store architecture** — every residual miss is a chunker/eval-spec issue, none is a vector ceiling. Both defects vanish under the planned **LLM tagger** (the marked swap-point in §8), which is semantic rather than regex-frequency. So: do the LLM-tagger swap (or, as a cheap interim, IDF-weight the heuristic ranking + broaden the `operating_kpis` cue) — that fixes the two tagger misses. **Buyback is separate:** the IDF fix does not touch it; it needs a gold-spec correction (drop or relax `expect_section: "Forward guidance"`, since authorization-size legitimately lives in the headline/table) or a section-boundary review — and a decision on whether the case should split "authorization size" from "capital-return policy." Then **re-run the gold eval before building pgvector** (step 3a). The experiment de-risks the store build (hybrid beats keyword; the residual gap is known, fixable chunker/eval-spec work, not a fundamental retrieval ceiling) but does not on its own justify "build the store now."

### 11b. Step 3a applied — re-run (2026-06-03)

Implemented the three fixes: (1) `tag_chunk` now ranks facets by **tf·idf** (IDF computed across the note's own chunks) with an alphabetical tie-break, so rare discriminating facets survive the ≤4 cap; (2) broadened the `operating_kpis` cue to cover hardware "new-segment / submarket / KPI disclosure" (doc + query side); (3) dropped the buyback case's `expect_section` assertion. Same gold set, same cached embeddings (only facet tags changed, not chunk text).

| Retriever | recall@1 | @3 | @5 |
|---|---|---|---|
| keyword baseline (`eval.py`) | **11**/17 (was 8) | — | — |
| vector only | 11 (was 9) | 14 (was 12) | **17** (was 14) |
| vector + facet pre-filter (hard) | 13 | 14 | 16 |
| **vector + facet boost (soft)** | **14** | **16** | **17** |

**All three originally-flagged misses now resolve at @1** (Vera TAM, segment KPI, buyback). Vector-only recall@5 is now perfect (17/17) — i.e. every gold answer is recoverable from a Store-A chunk; there is no narrative retrieval ceiling. Confirms §11a: the gap was chunker tagging/eval-spec, not retrieval.

**Finding — facets read better as a ranking *boost* than a *gate* (suggestive, one-case margin).** The re-run exposed a regression in the **hard** pre-filter: it costs recall@5 (16 vs vector-only's 17). Mechanism (verified): IDF correctly drops the common `revenue` facet from a Q&A chunk that *does* discuss revenue growth (case 9, Neoclouds/ACIE, answered by Huang); the query infers only `{revenue}`; so the hard filter excludes a chunk vector ranks inside the top-5. A **soft boost** (cosine + λ·fraction-of-query-facets-matched, λ=0.05) beats every variant at every k (14 / 16 / 17). **Caveat:** soft beats hard on *exactly one case* (case 9) at both @1 and @5 — the whole soft-vs-hard delta is n=1 of 17. The *principle* (facets as a ranking signal, not a hard gate) is sound on general-IR grounds and is what §7 should adopt; the *magnitude* is not measured here. λ=0.05 is untuned-but-works on this single note — tune on the multi-note corpus.

**Robustness spot-check (not a second gold eval).** Ran the modified chunker on two GOOGL notes (no NVDA-style segment disclosure): the broadened `operating_kpis` cue does **not** over-fire (5% / 10% of chunks, all via the *legacy* SaaS terms — the new `submarket`/`new segment`/`segmentation` terms fired on zero chunks), and the IDF facet distribution stays sane (common facets dominate, `market`/`capital_structure` rare). So the two tagging changes behave on a different company/structure.

**Net:** step 3a's three defects are **closed on NVDA-1Q27** and the tagging changes spot-check clean on GOOGL — but this is **one gold note**; the eval and the fixes were co-developed on it (and the buyback case was itself edited), so this is self-consistency + a robustness sniff, not generalization. **Before the pgvector build, add a second gold note (a GOOGL quarter) to step 3** so "soft-boost retriever is the spec" is earned rather than asserted. Carry the soft-boost retriever into step 4 as the *working* spec, not a proven one.

### 11c. Step 3b — second gold note (GOOGL 1Q26), generalization (2026-06-03)

Added a 15-case gold set (`eval_set_googl.yaml`) for `notes/GOOGL/20260429-1Q26.md` — a different company, same 10-section structure — written from the note **before** any GOOGL-specific fix. Generalized the harness (`eval.py --eval-set`; `embed_experiment.py` runs both notes + a combined line). Discipline note: unlike 3a, the gold set was authored and run *pre-fix* to surface gaps, and the fixes below are structural/operator-driven, not case-targeted.

**Pre-fix run found two real gaps + one of my own over-strict assertions:**
1. **Q&A answerer roster was hardcoded & CEO-centric.** `EXEC_ROLES` had `Pichai` but not `Ashkenazi` (CFO) or `Schindler` (CBO), so GOOGL Q&A items answered by them got `answered_by=None`. Mechanism isolated directly on the §8 chunks (not via the retriever). The "Ashkenazi margin" case was a *pure* roster miss — correct §8 item retrieved at rank 1, only the answerer assertion failed.
2. **Several cue vocabularies are NVDA-flavored** (e.g. the `product` cue name-drops Blackwell/Rubin/Vera; `competitive_advantage`'s "merchant silicon" is space- not hyphen-spelled). Mostly absorbed by other facets here, but flagged — the production LLM tagger removes this regex brittleness.
3. **Gold-spec over-reach (mine):** case 12 asserted `competitive_advantage` on the one chunk carrying "80% better performance per dollar"; that chunk tags `product` (defensible — TPU 8i is a product) and no chunk carries both → unwinnable, same class as the NVDA buyback case. Relaxed to `product`.

**Fixes applied** (structural, not note-specific): (a) **per-doc roster from the note's `speakers:` frontmatter**, merged over the global `EXEC_ROLES` (`_parse_roster` + `_norm_role` in `parse_doc_meta`, threaded through `chunk_note`→`_split_children`/`tag_chunk`) — resolves answerers for *any* ticker whose note carries speakers, with the global dict as fallback (NVDA has no speakers block → unaffected); (b) the case-12 gold relaxation; (c) **operator-requested** revenue-cue expansion (ARR / backlog / RPO / deferred-revenue / net-new-ARR now also tag `revenue`, multi-label alongside `operating_kpis`).

| Retriever | NVDA @1/3/5 | GOOGL @1/3/5 | **Combined (n=32)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| keyword baseline | 11/–/– | 6→7/–/– | — |
| vector only | 11/14/17 | 10/14/15 | 21/28/**32** |
| vector + facet pre-filter (hard) | 13/14/16 | 11/13/14 | 24/27/30 |
| **vector + facet boost (soft)** | 14/16/17 | **11/15/15** | **25/31/32** |

**Result:** GOOGL recall@5 went 12→**15/15** (perfect) post-fix; all three pre-fix misses resolved (Ashkenazi @1, Schindler @2, TPU @1). **NVDA unchanged → no regressions** from the roster/revenue changes. Combined vector-only **@5 = 32/32**: every gold answer on both notes is reachable in top-5 from a Store-A chunk — **no reachability gap on the constructed gold set** (the gold questions were authored *from* the notes with verified substrings, so this measures "when the right chunk exists, is it reached," not recall on the operator's real query distribution). Soft boost is best at every k combined (25/31/32); the soft-vs-hard @5 advantage is now **2 cases across 32** (32 vs 30), firmer than 3a's single-case margin but still small-n.

**Honest scope:** still 2 notes, both large-cap AI names with the same note template; the roster fix is structural (generalizes by construction) but the cue vocabularies remain NVDA/SaaS-flavored and will only fully generalize under the LLM tagger. **Gate: this clears 3b** — the chunker + soft-boost retriever now hold on a second, independently-authored gold note with no regressions. The soft-boost retriever is the spec to carry into step 4.

## 12. Step 4 — Store-A pipeline (2026-06-03)

The notebook spec is now a real pipeline. All under `scripts/chunking/`:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `schema.sql` | **Durable pgvector DDL** (Store A `chunks` + Store B `metrics` + the A↔B JOIN view sketch). Not executed today; the canonical target spec the file backend mirrors and the step-5 migration loads verbatim. `vector(3072)`. |
| `embed.py` | Shared Gemini `gemini-embedding-001` helper (key ← `/root/podcasts/.env`; `retrieval_document`/`retrieval_query`); sha256 content cache so re-ingest only embeds changed chunks. |
| `store.py` | `Store` interface + `FileStore` (numpy cosine over `state/chunk_store/`) + `PgStore` step-5 stub. `get_store()` ← `CHUNK_STORE_BACKEND` (`file` default \| `pg`). Ranking = the proven cosine + facet soft boost; §7 operator-opinion + recency boosts are additional, default-OFF weights. |
| `ingest.py` | `notes/**/*.md → chunk_note → embed children → upsert`. Idempotent; survives a malformed note (logs+skips). `--all` / `--note` / `--rebuild`. |
| `retrieve.py` | `query → embed → search → auto-merge to parent (§3a)`. Production §7 boosts ON; `retrieve(..., production_boosts=False)` reproduces the bare proven retriever. |
| `eval_store.py` | The step-4 **regression gate**: 32 gold cases through `retrieve.py → FileStore`. |

**The temporal decision (file-backed now, managed pgvector at step 5).** pgvector is locked (§9), but the JOIN that justifies a database — Store-A narrative ↔ Store-B beat-rate (§2, §2a) — does not exist until step 5. At ~2,300 child chunks numpy cosine is sub-ms, and the repo is flat-files-in-git + cron with no DB daemon anywhere (operator memo: *"Managed Postgres if/when flat files stop scaling"*). So `schema.sql` is written in real pgvector dialect as the durable artifact, but the job runs against `FileStore` today, behind a `Store` seam whose swap to managed pgvector (`PgStore`, `CHUNK_STORE_BACKEND=pg`) is the **step-5 trigger** — when Store B lands and the JOIN earns the daemon. Nothing in the schema work is throwaway; only a ~60-line file adapter is.

**Verification (gold eval through the shipped pipeline = §11c exactly):**

| Retriever (via `retrieve.py → FileStore`) | NVDA @1/3/5 | GOOGL @1/3/5 | Combined (n=32) |
|---|---|---|---|
| vector + facet boost (soft), `production_boosts=False` | 14/16/17 | 11/15/15 | **25/31/32** |

Matches `embed_experiment.py` to the case — the production path reproduces the proven retriever, not just a notebook. Backend seam verified (`pg` → step-5 `NotImplementedError`; unknown backend → `ValueError`). `_parse_roster` hardened against a bare-string `speakers:` entry → all 56 notes now chunk (487 parents + 2,339 children); keyword baseline unchanged (NVDA 11/17, GOOGL 7/15 → no regression).

**⚠ Open operational item:** the full-corpus embed (all 56 notes) is **blocked on an expired Gemini key** in `/root/podcasts/.env`. The pipeline was verified offline on the 2 gold notes via the cached 3b embeddings. Once the key is refreshed: `python3 scripts/chunking/ingest.py --all --rebuild` embeds + loads the whole corpus (one command, idempotent).
